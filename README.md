Flight Computer Repository
==========================

This is the GitHub repository for all software pertaining to Purdue Orbital's *Hapsis Project* flight computer. Programs are coded in Python for use on a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+.


## Getting Started ##

### 1. Connecting to the Raspberry Pi ###

Currently, there are four flight computers -- all RPi Model 3 B+, one of which operates in the BIDC with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This setup has been found to be more reliable than the following method. Connection can either be local, or over `PAL3.0`. 

//NOTE: Currently, WiFi is not configured for this Pi, so this method isn't functional.

To connect through SSH, PuTTY can be used (Windows) or the terminal (MacOS). Windows users can also use the command prompt. On the Pi, type `ifconfig | grep 'inet '`. The output should look something like:

`ζ:~/Github/Avionics$ ifconfig | grep 'inet '`  

        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet 10.186.110.99  netmask 255.255.240.0  broadcast 10.186.111.255
        
The Pi's local IP address for `PAL3.0` is preceded by `inet`, and on the same line as `broadcast`. In this example, it is `10.186.110.99`. Follow the instructions in the next section using this IP instead of the local Pi IP.


### 2. Connecting to the Raspberry Pi (Headless) ###

Currently, there are four flight computers -- all RPi Model 3 B+, three of which share the name `AvionicsPiX`, where `X` is the system number documented on the Pi packaging. It can be connected to through SSH (Secure Shell). The Pi broadcasts its own network, called `AvionicsPiAPX`, and is used as an access point to SSH into. Users must first power on the Pi (it may take up to a minute to fully boot up). Once the Pi is booted, users should notice a new network available to connect to with the name `AvionicsPiAPX`. Connect to it using the password `PurdueOrbital`. You will now be on a local network containing the Pi and your computer. Internet is available by connecting an ethernet cable to the Pi's port -- this makes it act as an access point to `PAL3.0`.

To connect through SSH, PuTTY can be used (Windows) or the terminal (MacOS). Windows users can also use the command prompt.

*  **Windows Users:** Open the PuTTY client. In the prompt beneath **Host Name (or IP address)** type the following: 

   `pi@192.168.#.1` - # is indicated on the Pi packaging

   Here `pi` denotes the user on the machine, and `192.168.#.1` is the static IP address. You can save this device using the **Save** and **Load** functions. Afterwards, press **Open**. You will be redirected to a terminal, and 
   prompted:

   `pi@192.168.#.1's password: `

   Enter the following password exactly as displayed:
                        
   `PurdueOrbital`
   
   Upon first login, you will be asked something along these lines:
   
   `Authenticity of the host ... cannot be established. Do you ...?`

   Enter `yes`.

   You are now connected to the Pi via SSH. You may also be able to type `ssh pi@192.168.#.1` into the command prompt and proceed as follows, but I'm not 100% on that. If connection fails, see **Troubleshooting**.

*  **MacOS Users:** {Not yet determined}


## Troubleshooting ##

*  ### Unable to connect to the Pi (can't reach server) ###

   Check that your computer has properly established connection to the network. On Windows, open the command prompt. Enter `ipconfig`, and under the section labelled `Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi` verify that `IPv4 Address` is of the 
   form `192.168.#.XXX`, where `XXX` is any number from 2 to 20. If it isn't, your computer hasn't properly acquired a new local IP. In this case, either reboot your machine or type the following commands:

   `ipconfig /release`

   `ipconfig /flushdns`

   `ipconfig /renew`

   This will refresh your connection settings without requiring a system reboot. Renewing may take a minute or two, so don't be alarmed if it appears to be stall on `Windows IP Configuration`. Afterwards, verify that your IP is now 
   correctly configured by repeating the steps above.

### Please report any further problems to appropriate person(s). ###
